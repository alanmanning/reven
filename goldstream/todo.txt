ADMIN USERNAME: alan@alan.com
ADMIN PASSWORD: testicle

DONE:
-Implemented email login following this article: https://www.fomfus.com/articles/how-to-use-email-as-username-for-django-authentication-removing-the-username .
-Email login for admin site works
-User registration site also works


TODO:
-Have made a view to send the activation email. Need to figure out how to make the URL for this.
 You were at line 28 of views.py. Need to also confirm that send_act_email_view(request,uidb64,token) works

EVENTUALLY:
-Add Django-axes to disable users after repeated logins. Right now they don't have support
 for Django-1.11.
