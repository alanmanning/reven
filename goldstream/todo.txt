-Email login for admin site works
-User registration site also works


TODO:
-Create a new model for BCHAccounts. May as well make a User model. Link this to the User model using a one-to-many relationship.
 	-Implement salt and hashing of passwords. Use secret_key.
 		-Look up how to get the password text from the hashed value.
 	-One specific account. Multiple BCH logins can have one account
-Create a form for user homepage to add BCHAccounts. Do this from the model?

EVENTUALLY:
-Add Django-axes to disable users after repeated logins. Right now they don't have support
 for Django-1.11.
 -Test user login
