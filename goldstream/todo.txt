ADMIN USERNAME: alan@alan.com
ADMIN PASSWORD: goldstreams

DONE:
-Implemented email login following this article: https://www.fomfus.com/articles/how-to-use-email-as-username-for-django-authentication-removing-the-username .
-Email login for admin site works
-User registration site also works


TODO:
-Use Django's built-in views for user account management. Get these to work.
	-Will want to write in the urls myself instead of including them. More explict
	that way.
	-Need to make templates.
	-Add appropriate errors on password change page. Need to get the form errors themselves.
	 right now I am looking only at the keys
